This project is free software but not conventional open source: its primary
output is video, not code, so the goal is to record myself writing everything
rather than collect community contributions.

Issues and pull requests are welcome as a rich, async alternative to the
stream’s live chat. I won’t merge PRs because I don’t want to break the streak
of “every line of code was written on the stream”, but I’m happy to receive
issues & PRs which report bugs, make suggestions or show examples of how the
code might be improved.

When writing a PR, bear in mind that I might only read the description, not the
code, to avoid “spoilers”.

I’m grateful for all audience participation, so thank you in advance!
